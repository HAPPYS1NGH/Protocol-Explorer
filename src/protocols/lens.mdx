## Introduction to Lens Protocol

The Lens Protocol is a Web3 social graph deployed on the Polygon Proof-of-Stake blockchain. It is meticulously designed to empower creators, enabling them to own the links between themselves and their community. This results in a fully composable, user-owned social graph that offers modularity for integrating new features and fixes while ensuring the immutability of user-owned content and social relationships.

## Lens Protocol vs. Existing Social Networks

Lens Protocol addresses significant issues present in traditional social media networks. In Web2 networks, data is stored in unique, centralized databases, lacking portability. Profiles, friends, and content are confined to a specific network and owned by the network operator, leading to a zero-sum game for user attention.

Lens Protocol introduces a paradigm shift by being a user-owned, open social graph accessible to any application. Users have ownership of their data, allowing them to bring it to any application built on top of Lens Protocol. Creators, as true owners of their content, no longer face the risk of losing content, audience, and livelihood due to individual platform algorithms and policies. Additionally, each application using Lens Protocol contributes to the overall ecosystem, transforming the zero-sum game into a collaborative environment. Developers can craft meaningful social experiences without resorting to mechanisms that lock in user attention.
