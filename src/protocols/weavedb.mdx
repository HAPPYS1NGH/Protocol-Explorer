## What is WeaveDB?

WeaveDB is a NoSQL database powered by Warp Contracts on the Arweave blockchain. WeaveDB is addressing this issue by offering a decentralized database layer that is not only scalable but also free to use and faster than many traditional web2 solutions.

## How WeaveDB Works

WeaveDB is a decentralized database system that uses the Arweave network as its underlying storage layer. It is designed to offer a scalable, secure, and fast solution for data storage.

## Why WeaveDB (Features)

WeaveDB offers several advantages over traditional web2 solutions:

- Fast query performance: The query performance is often faster than web2 solutions.

- Cheap permanent storage: Data is stored on Arweave.

- Prepaid gas fees: With Bundlr, developers can cover gas fees upfront.

- Cross-chain crypto authentication: WeaveDB supports authentication using any EVM-based, DFINITY, and ArConnect wallets.

- Decentralized APIs: APIs similar to Firestore but completely decentralized.

- Cross-chain data bridges: Allowing developers to easily import their data from different blockchain networks and even web2 APIs.

- Data encryption: You can use Lit protocol to encrypt data, ensuring data privacy and security.

- Scalability: WeaveDB is virtually infinitely scalable, making it ideal for large-scale decentralized applications.

- Built-in decentralized indexer: Making it easy to search and query large datasets without relying on a centralized indexer.

- Scheduled tasks: Allowing developers to execute actions on-chain at specified times.
