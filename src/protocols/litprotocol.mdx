## What is Lit Protocol?

Lit is a decentralized key management network and platform for building applications and experiences that leverage threshold cryptography. With Lit, you can create and control keys and run code for virtually any application that can be made private, immutable, and/or autonomous.

The system builds off contemporary work in applied cryptography, secure enclaves, and distributed systems to provide the maximum amount of control and privacy to end users, without requiring an extensive technical understanding of key management or public key cryptography.

Developers can use Lit to build apps with private data, intuitive wallet onboarding and asset management experiences, and immutable serverless functions that run based on the rules you set.

## Get Started with the Lit SDK

Explore the [Lit SDK documentation](https://developer.litprotocol.com/v3/) to get started with building on the Lit Protocol.

## Use Cases

Lit Protocol can be utilized for various web3 applications, including:

- DeFi: Conditional transaction execution, infrastructure for recurring payments, liquid staking solutions, and more.

- Infrastructure: Cross-chain bridges, oracles for off-chain data, privacy-preserving transactions, and signers for smart accounts.

- Sovereign Data: Programmable credential issuance and selective disclosure for user data.

- Web3 Social: Private data in social apps, token-gated video streaming, decentralized chatbots, and on-chain reputation building.

- Gaming: Seamless onboarding, condition-based rewards, and private data in multiplayer games.

- Token Gating for Web2 Apps: Token-based access control for Shopify, Zoom, Google Drive, and WordPress.
