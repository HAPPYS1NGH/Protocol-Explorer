## What is Streamr?

Streamr provides the real-time data infrastructure of the decentralised web (Web3). Their technology is a core service layer implementing a vendor-neutral, real-time publish/subscribe protocol for data transmission. The data travels via a global peer-to-peer network, scalable, robust, and permissionless. Streamr works in tandem with companion blockchains like Ethereum, Gnosis, and Polygon, which are used for identity, security, and payments.

## Key Features

- Decentralised Data Infrastructure: Streamr's technology offers a decentralised broadcast messaging protocol, ensuring low latency and security through a fault-tolerant, resilient, and scalable peer-to-peer architecture.

- Blockchain Integration: The technology works in tandem with blockchain networks such as Ethereum, Gnosis, and Polygon, providing identity, security, and payment functionalities.

- Global Peer-to-Peer Network: Data is transmitted via a global peer-to-peer network, making it scalable, robust, and permissionless.

## Challenges Solved by Streamr

- Connecting Billions of Devices: Streamr addresses the challenge of connecting billions of devices worldwide with real-time data through a decentralised network.

- Single Point of Failure: Existing centralised services often face a single point of failure. Streamr's decentralised approach eliminates this vulnerability.

- Vendor Lock-In: Centralised services are prone to vendor lock-in. Streamr's vendor-neutral protocol ensures more flexibility.
