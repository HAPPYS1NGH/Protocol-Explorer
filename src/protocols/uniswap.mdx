## What is Uniswap?

Uniswap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on Ethereum, allowing users to swap various ERC-20 tokens without relying on traditional order books.

 Connect Wallet: Connect your Ethereum wallet that holds your tokens.
 Swap Tokens: Swap tokens directly from your wallet without the need for order matching.

## Advantages of Uniswap

- Decentralized Trading: Uniswap operates without an intermediary, ensuring decentralized and permissionless token swaps.
  
- Automated Market Making: Its AMM model provides liquidity by enabling users to trade against a liquidity pool rather than order books.
  
- Liquidity Provision: Users can contribute to liquidity pools and earn fees by providing tokens to facilitate trades.

## Uniswap Use Cases

Uniswap serves various purposes in the Ethereum ecosystem, including:

- Token Swapping: Instantly swap between a wide array of ERC-20 tokens.
  
- Liquidity Provision: Provide liquidity to pools and earn fees.
