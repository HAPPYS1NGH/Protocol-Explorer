## What is Phala Network?

Computation as it’s meant to be.

## Our Mission

Phala Network is revolutionizing Web3 by providing dApp developers with an off-chain compute infrastructure that is truly decentralized and trustless. By connecting Smart Contracts to our off-chain programs called Phat Contracts, developers can supercharge their dApps with seamless cross-chain integrations, connectivity to the internet, and heavy computation. Phat Contracts make your Smart Contracts even smarter and can be integrated in minutes using our no-code developer experience.

## Trustless Computation. Verifiable Results.

Phala Network is designed with multiple layers of security guarantees to provide fully verifiable computation. Anybody with the correct hardware can become a compute providing “Worker” for the network and earn rewards, and Phala has an array of mechanisms in place to ensure Workers always carry out computation faithfully and securely. Zero-knowledge proofs, hardware-based assurances, and cryptographic evidence of execution published and verified on the Phala blockchain enable Phat Contract to seamlessly extend blockchain-level security to the off-chain realm.

## Supercharge Your dApps with Phat Contract

Developers can use Phala Network by deploying Phat Contracts, programs that run on Phala Network’s off-chain Workers that can interface with Smart Contracts on any chain.

Our low-code experience, Phat Contract 2.0, uses pre-written, audited Phat Contracts to form complex functions using TypeScript/JavaScript that developers can integrate with their Smart Contracts in minutes.
