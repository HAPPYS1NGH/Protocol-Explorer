## What is Ocean Protocol?

Ocean is a decentralized data exchange protocol that powers the AI ecosystem by providing a robust tech stack, including Datatokens and Compute-to-Data. The protocol is designed to enable decentralized access control, token-gating, and privacy-preserving data transactions.

## Key Features of Ocean Protocol

- Datatokens: Publish data services as ERC721 data NFTs and ERC20 datatokens, enabling decentralized access control through token-gating.

- Compute-to-Data (C2D): This feature allows the buying and selling of private data while preserving privacy. C2D grants access to run compute against the data without the data leaving the premises.


## Datatokens and Decentralized Data Access

- Publishing Data Services: Data services are published as ERC721 data NFTs and ERC20 datatokens.

- Accessing Data: Holders of 1.0 datatokens can access the dataset or data service, and consuming data services involves spending datatokens.

- Blockchain Integration: Crypto wallets, exchanges, and DAOs become data wallets, exchanges, and DAOs.

## Compute-to-Data (C2D) for Privacy-Preserving Data Transactions

- Private Data Value: C2D allows the buying and selling of private data, preserving privacy by running compute on the same premises as the data.

- Decentralized Handshaking: Blockchain technology facilitates the handshaking process, ensuring privacy without moving the data.

## Ocean Community

Ocean boasts a vibrant ecosystem with enthusiastic developers, data scientists, OCEAN holders, and Ocean Ambassadors. The community actively engages in predictions, data challenges, Data Farming, and more.
