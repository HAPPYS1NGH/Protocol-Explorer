## What is Aragon?

Aragon is an open-source software framework that allows for the creation and management of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides a suite of applications and services that enable new forms of global communities, allowing individuals to organize around capital assets, currency, or tokens.

## Key Features of Aragon

- aragonOS: An open-source smart contract development framework that can be used by any DAO, dApp, or protocol.

- Aragon App (NEW): DAO creation and management platform with no coding required.

## Benefits of Aragon for DAOs

- Decentralized Governance: Aragon enables organizations to implement decentralized governance models with customizable voting mechanisms, permissions, and dispute resolution systems.

- Customizable Voting System: Aragon DAOs use a customizable voting system to facilitate decision-making within the organization, including simple majority voting, weighted voting based on token holdings, or more complex voting mechanisms.

- Wide Range of Use Cases: Aragon DAOs have been implemented across various industries and use cases, including decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, blockchain-based games, non-profit organizations, decentralized insurance platforms, tokenized real estate, decentralized marketplaces, and more.

- Open-Source Framework: Aragon is an open-source software framework that allows for the creation and management of DAOs on the Ethereum blockchain.

- User-Friendly Development Tools: Provides user-friendly development tools, such as templates and apps, to simplify the process of creating and managing DAOs.

- Scalability: Aragon is massively scalable for usage by both private firms and public sector organizations, with over 3,800 DAOs created on the platform.
