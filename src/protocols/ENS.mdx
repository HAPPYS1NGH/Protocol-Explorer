## What is ENS?

The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a distributed, open, and extensible naming system built on the Ethereum blockchain. ENS's primary function is to map human-readable names like 'alice.eth' to machine-readable identifiers, including Ethereum addresses, other cryptocurrency addresses, content hashes, and metadata.

## Key Features of ENS

- Decentralized Naming: ENS operates on a decentralized system, similar to DNS, allowing users to have human-readable names associated with their Ethereum addresses.

- Hierarchical Structure: ENS uses a hierarchical structure of dot-separated domains, granting full control to domain owners and supporting subdomains.

## How ENS Works

ENS allows users to register and configure domains, similar to traditional domain name systems. Owners of top-level domains, such as '.eth' and '.test', have control over their subdomains, enabling easy customization.

## Benefits of ENS

- Human-Readable Addresses: ENS makes it possible to use human-readable names in place of complex Ethereum addresses.

- Reverse Resolution: ENS supports 'reverse resolution', associating metadata with Ethereum addresses.
