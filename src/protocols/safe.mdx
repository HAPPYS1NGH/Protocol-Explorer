## What is Safe?

Gnosis Safe is like a high-security digital vault for your cryptocurrencies and digital assets. It's a type of wallet, but with enhanced security features. Unlike traditional wallets, which typically rely on a single key for access, Gnosis Safe implements a multi-signature approach. This means that to execute transactions, multiple approvals from a group of trusted individuals or devices are required, adding an extra layer of security.
