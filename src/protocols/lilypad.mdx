## What is Lilypad?

Lilypad is developing a trustless, distributed compute network that enables internet-scale data processing, AI, ML & other arbitrary computation from blockchains, while unleashing idle processing power & unlocking a new marketplace for compute.

## How Does Lilypad Work?

Lilypad provides decentralized AI computational services. By extending unrestricted, global access to computational power, Lilypad strategically collaborates with decentralized infrastructure networks, such as Filecoin, to formulate a transparent, efficient, and accessible computational ecosystem. Perform off-chain decentralised compute over data, with on-chain guarantees, and to call this functionality directly from a smart contract, CLI and an easy to use abstraction layer, opens the door to a multitude of possible applications.

## Advantages of Filecoin

- Decentralized Storage Market: Filecoin facilitates open markets for storing and retrieving files, ensuring availability and price transparency without centralized control.
  
- Integration with IPFS: Built upon the IPFS protocol, Filecoin leverages content addressing and offers incentives for reliable storage and access of contents.

## Filecoin Use Cases

Filecoin caters to diverse use cases, from NFT and metaverse assets storage to incentivized permanent storage and archiving Web2 datasets. For instance:

- NFT.Storage: Utilizes Filecoin for simple decentralized storage solutions for NFT contents and metadata.
  

  
- Support for Various Data Formats: Supports audio, video files, empowering platforms like Audius and Huddle01 for music streaming and video conferencing using decentralized storage.
