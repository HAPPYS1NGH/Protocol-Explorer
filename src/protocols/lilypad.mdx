## What is Lilypad?

Lilypad is developing a trustless, distributed compute network that enables internet-scale data processing, AI, ML & other arbitrary computation from blockchains, while unleashing idle processing power & unlocking a new marketplace for compute.

## How Does Lilypad Work?

Lilypad provides decentralized AI computational services. By extending unrestricted, global access to computational power, Lilypad strategically collaborates with decentralized infrastructure networks, such as Filecoin, to formulate a transparent, efficient, and accessible computational ecosystem. Perform off-chain decentralised compute over data, with on-chain guarantees, and to call this functionality directly from a smart contract, CLI and an easy to use abstraction layer, opens the door to a multitude of possible applications.

## Advantages of Filecoin

- Verifiable Trustless Decentralized Compute Network: Lilypad is a decentralized compute network that provides global, permissionless access to compute power. It leverages decentralized physical infrastructure networks like Filecoin to ensure trustlessness and verifiability.
  
- Mainstream Web3 Application Support: Lilypad is designed to enable mainstream web3 applications to use its compute network. It aims to make decentralized AI more accessible, efficient, and transparent for developers and users.

- [Lilypad AI Studio](https://app.lilypad.tech/) provides an interface for non-technical users to run models like SDXL 0.9 and Mistral 7b on the open compute network with a simple interafce.

## Advantages of Lilypad

By leveraging decentralized infrastructure networks such as Filecoin, Lilypad is strategically positioned to enhance the efficiency, transparency, and accessibility of high-performance computing hardware.
